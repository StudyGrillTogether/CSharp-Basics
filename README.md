- # Day 2

## OOP Concepts: Classes and Objects

---

## Learning Objectives
- Learn all types of errors in C#
- Understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Theory
- What is a class and what is an object  
- How do we create an object in C#  
- Why OOP? (bundling data + behaviour together)  
- How to use an object to instantiate methods and fields  

---

## Practice
- Create a class `Person` with:
  - `name`
  - `age`
- Add a method called `Introduce` in the class  

---

## Exercise (GitHub)
- Create a class called `Person` which will have:
  - Two fields: `name` and `age`
  - A method `Introduce`
- Create three people and print their introductions  
- Add one more class called `Address` with fields:
  1. `street`
  2. `city`
- Attach `Address` to `Person` as a field (should be a simple **has-a relationship**)  
- Do this in **Day 1**
- You have to add an option saying:
  - After you have done your process, you will give an option to the user if he wants to quit or not  
  - If he says **yes**, then you exit  
  - Otherwise, you repeat the operation  
  - The same applies unless he says **no**
